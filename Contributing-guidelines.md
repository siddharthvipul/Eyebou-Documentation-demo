## Welcome to Eyebou’s Open Source Contributing Guide!

Thank you for your time and interest in contributing to our project. Any contribution you make will be greatly appreciated and reflected here: https://github.com/EyebouImpact


In this guide we will cover the following:
<p> Opening an issue, Creating a pull request, Reviewing, Merging a pull request 


## Getting Started

To get an overview of the project, read the Readme.


### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists https://github.com/EyebouImpact/EyebouImpact/issues. If your issue doesn’t exist you can open up a new issue.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our https://github.com/EyebouImpact/EyebouImpact/issues to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in the UI

Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and create a pull request for a review. 


#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.

2. Use the command line
  - so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

3. Install or update to **Node.js v16**. 

4. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, an Eyebou team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
