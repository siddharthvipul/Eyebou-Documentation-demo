The goal is to understand what\u2019s in the image at a pixel level. Image Classification - Bounding boxes are used to detect objects. Upload raw images into system Image annotation tool - Vector pen allows drawing freehand and generating straight lines Draw regions on image Label clearly and correctly what the disease is Label clearly and correctly when there is no evidence of the disease Save data to standardised format Second annotator labels and reviews previous annotations Save data to standardised format Ready for data training Data Quality Checks Consistency Accuracy of labelled data Labelled twice with majority voting Meticulous training of annotators Gold standard, consensus, review We will have a benchmark which is a designated labelled asset as a \u2018gold standard\u2019 and compare other annotations to that asset. Canary Deployment We will deploy smaller batches of labelled images and work iteratively before labelling the total dataset. Collaboration and performance monitoring We have an organized system to invite and supervise all labelers during an image annotation project. We will monitor data efficiency via 1) Throughput 2) Efficiency 3) Quality","title":"Quality assurance"},{"location":"Contribute/Code-of-conduct/","text":"Contributor Code of Conduct Our Promise Eyebou as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Thank you for your time and interest in contributing to our project. Any contribution you make will be greatly appreciated and reflected here: https://github.com/EyebouImpact In this guide we will cover the following: Opening an issue, Creating a pull request, Reviewing, Merging a pull request ## Getting Started To get an overview of the project, read the Readme. ### Issues #### Create a new issue If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists https://github.com/EyebouImpact/EyebouImpact/issues. If your issue doesn\u2019t exist you can open up a new issue. #### Solve an issue Scan through our https://github.com/EyebouImpact/EyebouImpact/issues to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix. ### Make Changes #### Make changes in the UI Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and create a pull request for a review. #### Make changes locally 1. Fork the repository. 2. Use the command line - so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them. 3. Install or update to **Node.js v16**. 4. Create a working branch and start with your changes! ### Commit your update Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process:zap:. ### Pull Request When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR. - Fill the \"Ready for review\" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. - Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one. - Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
